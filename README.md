# InternetMarket
This is a template for a web application that is an online store where users can buy and sell products.
Authorization, authentication and user registration are implemented in this application. 
When registering a user, he confirms his email address with a code (Sending must be done from a valid email address, and the appropriate permission must be enabled on your account).
When opening a project in your Visual Studio, the database will be created automatically when you launch the project, but the correct email address for mailing will need to be specified in the EmailService file. 
The project was created using ASP.Net Core 5 and may not work on other versions ASP.Net Core.
